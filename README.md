# Twilight Moon ðŸŒ™

This is a small front-end project I made while learning HTML and CSS.  
It shows a basic webpage with a navigation bar and some sample sections.

# ðŸ”— Live Demo :

You can see the project online [here](https://sahrsalem.github.io/twilight-moon/)

## About :

The page includes:
- Navigation links (Home, Product, Shop, About, Contact)
- Simple layout and placeholder text
- Basic styling using CSS

This helped me practice:
- Writing HTML structure
- Styling with CSS
- Publishing a site using GitHub Pages

# Disclaimer :

This is a learning project.  
The design and idea are based on a free tutorial.  
I donâ€™t own the original design or visuals.
