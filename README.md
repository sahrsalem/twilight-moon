# Twilight Moon (Training Project)

This project is part of my front-end development training.  
It was built as a practice exercise to explore HTML, CSS animations, and responsive design techniques.

 **Disclaimer:**  
 The design and concept are based on a publicly available tutorial or template.  
 I do not claim ownership of the original idea or visuals.

## What I learned
- Structuring HTML elements for animated scenes
- Applying CSS transitions and keyframes
- Managing layout responsiveness across devices
- Using Git and GitHub for version control


## My goal
To improve my front-end skills through hands-on practice and respectful learning.
